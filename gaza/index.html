            <h6>The people of Gaza are being exterminated.</h6>
            <p>A large part of the population of the besieged Gaza Strip is subjected to genocide, as thousands have
                been martyred and injured by the continuous Israeli bombing since the Palestinian resistance launched
                Operation Al-Aqsa Flood. What is happening is that a large part of the Palestinian population in Gaza is
                being eliminated, not differently than before but with increasing ferocity. Commenting on the decision
                of the Zionist entity to cut off the supply of water, electricity, food, and other basic facilities from
                Gaza, UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese explained that starving the besieged population in Gaza and
                depriving them of essentials is a war crime and a crime against humanity. Meanwhile, the United Nations
                has announced that more than 423,000 Palestinians have been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip
                by heavy Israeli shelling that has been ongoing for nearly a week. The United Nations Relief and Works
                Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNJWA) said earlier that tens of thousands had taken refuge in its
                schools in the Gaza Strip to escape the shelling of the Israeli occupation.</p>

            <h6>Israel is breaking international law.</h6>
            <p>Israel targeted the western port area of Gaza on Wednesday with several white phosphorus bombs, resulting
                in hundreds of cases of suffocation, Palestinian medical sources said. The sources confirmed the attack
                led to hundreds of Palestinians suffering from suffocation, with a significant number of them being
                transported to hospitals while others received on-site medical treatment. Most of the injuries were
                observed among children and the elderly, particularly those with pre-existing respiratory conditions,
                according to the sources. An extensive area in western Gaza was reportedly covered with white
                phosphorus, as per Anadolu's correspondent. White phosphorus bombs are internationally prohibited under
                the 1980 Geneva Convention, which explicitly forbids their use as incendiary weapons against both humans
                and the environment</p>

            <p>The occupation has bombed all areas of Gaza. It has bombed the Rimal neighbourhood, which is considered
                the largest economic area in Gaza. Jabaliya Camp, which is one of the largest camps in the world, was
                also bombed. The area of dignity was completely bombed. The occupation deliberately bombed major
                residential towers, such as the Palestine Tower, which contains 15 floors.</p>

            <h6>That's why Hamas was attacked.</h6>
            <p>Saleh Al-Arouri, deputy head of the political bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), stressed
                that the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, which was started by the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the military
                wing of Hamas, came in anticipation of an attack that Israel intended to launch on the Gaza Strip
                immediately after the Jewish holidays, and said that the defence plan for the operation is stronger than
                the offensive plan that surprised Israel and surprised the world. And also in response to Israel's
                acquisition against Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>

            <h6>Israel-Gaza War Daily Updates</h6>
            <p>At least 447 children and 248 women are among the 1,417 killed in Israeli strikes in the Gaza Strip, the
                Palestinian Health Ministry said today. The ministry also said that 6,268 people have been injured since
                Saturday. Earlier today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to "crush" Hamas and urged the
                world to treat them the same way as the Islamic State group. "Just as ISIS was crushed, so too will
                Hamas be crushed. And Hamas should be treated exactly the way ISIS was treated," he said as he met
                visiting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Over 3,600 people have so far been killed in Israel and
                Gaza after the sudden Hamas strikes triggered a catastrophic war in the region. Israel has also
                announced a complete siege of Gaza, effectively blocking electricity, food, and water supply. The United
                Nations said that more than 3 lakh people have been forced to flee their homes in the Gaza Strip as
                heavy Israeli bombardments continue to hit the Palestinian enclave.</p>
